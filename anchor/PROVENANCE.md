# Anchor provenance

The three executables in this directory are the fixed-point Luna toolchain
from the archived `m0` branch, byte-identical to the tools inside the
canonical seed archive:

```text
luna-bootstrap-seed-0.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar
SHA-256: see ../release/seeds/
```

They are freestanding static x86-64 Linux ELF64 files built from pure Luna
sources by the m0 bootstrap pipeline (C23 seed -> stage 1 -> stage 2 ->
stage 3, with stage 2 and stage 3 byte-for-byte identical). They contain no
libc, no dynamic loader and no hosted assembler or linker output.

This directory is the sole trusted binary input of the repository. Every
later toolchain is built from the Luna sources in `library/`, `compiler/`
and `drivers/` using these anchors, then verified against its own rebuild
(`python3 tools/selfhost.py verify`).

Replace the anchor only after a green `verify` run, together with refreshed
`SHA256SUMS` and a new provenance note.
